# Data Flow Diagram – Level 1
## Intelligent Business Process Automation (BPA) Platform

---

## Purpose of the Diagram

The Level 1 Data Flow Diagram expands the Level 0 Context Diagram by decomposing the Intelligent BPA Platform into its major internal processes. It illustrates how data flows between processes, external entities, and data stores, providing a more detailed understanding of system functionality.

## Major Processes Identified

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**  
   Validates user credentials and determines access privileges.

2. **Workflow and Rule Management**  
   Allows administrators to define workflows and configure business rules.

3. **Workflow Execution Engine**  
   Executes workflows dynamically by applying business rules and generating tasks.

4. **Task Management and Approvals**  
   Handles task assignment, completion, and managerial approval or rejection.

5. **SLA Monitoring and Escalation**  
   Monitors task deadlines and triggers automatic escalation in case of SLA violations.

6. **Analytics and Reporting**  
   Analyzes workflow execution data and generates performance reports.

7. **Notification Management**  
   Sends automated notifications for task updates, approvals, and escalations.

## Data Stores Used

- **D1: User and Role Database** – Stores authentication and authorization data.
- **D2: Workflow Repository** – Stores workflow definitions.
- **D3: Business Rules Store** – Stores configurable decision rules.
- **D4: Task and Approval Data Store** – Maintains task status and approval history.
- **D5: Analytics and Logs Store** – Stores execution metrics and logs.

## Key Data Flow Description

- Users are authenticated using data from the User and Role Database.
- Workflow definitions and rules are stored and retrieved dynamically during execution.
- Tasks generated by the workflow engine are stored and updated in the Task Data Store.
- SLA monitoring continuously evaluates task deadlines and triggers escalation when required.
- Analytics processes use execution logs to generate insights and reports.
- Notifications are sent via an external Email Notification Service.

## Significance

The Level 1 DFD highlights the intelligent and modular nature of the BPA Platform by clearly separating workflow execution, rule processing, SLA monitoring, analytics, and notifications. This decomposition demonstrates scalability, maintainability, and automation intelligence, which differentiates the system from traditional workflow solutions.
